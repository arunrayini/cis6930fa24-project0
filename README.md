# Project Description:
This project is aimed at retrieving incident report data from a PDF file provided through a URL. The program extracts key details, organizes the data into tuples, and stores it in a SQLite database. It then analyzes the data and presents the counts of various incident types for further review. The PDF contains a daily incident summary, and the code handles processing and structuring this information for better analysis.
